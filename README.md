# Gym-Scheduler-
Worked with Python classes to manage the schedule of a gym. A Gym consists of many rooms and each room has a maximum capacity. The gym follows a Schedule where, at different times in the day, a room may have a Workout Class scheduled in it. A workout class is taught by an Instructor provided they have the proper qualifications (in the form of certificates) to teach it. A gym offering is a workout class taking place in a specific room, at a specific time, and taught by a specific instructor. Clients can register for these offerings provided there is enough space in the room.
